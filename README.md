I have implemented a simplified version of a popular casino game Three
Card Poker (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Card_Poker).

My implementation will rely on a full set of the Python language features including object-oriented programming, and mutable compound data types
(such as lists and dictionaries). It will also involve implementing m complex control flows to support various parts of the game logic
